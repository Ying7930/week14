# week14


- I'm major in animation, so I wanted to do somthing is about it.  tried to made up a 360degree POV set with a squichy ball that will jump higher when the light is low.  My inspiration is from zoetrope, it is one of the pre-film animation devices.
- The LED part is the most easy but the most needs the time.  I have 11 frams, and each fram have 64 rows, which I will have to be very careful other wise the frame will not be correct.  And debug will have to strats at the very begining of the frame, Arduino vertify will not help, because for it the code do make sense.
- Other then that, soldering is very fun.  Have to be careful not to get burn and not to put to much of iron, it a work that needs concentration and speed.
- I made two borads of LEDs, which is less than what I expected.  Because I found out my POV is really small, and one will be very enough.  The second borad I was wanted to make a POC clock, but found out the other Arduino cannot be uploaded.  So my POV set having two wings, but only one side of LEDs are doing their works.
